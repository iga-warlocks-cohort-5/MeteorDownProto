# MeteorDownProto
Prototype for Meteor Down! game idea.
## Pitch
You are a captain of a space station tasked with defending earth. You use different cards to solve different hazards like meteor showers, Solar Rays, Aliens and other space like hazards. You must also keep your crew alive with ship repairs, Food Rations, and other upkeep cards. The only catch is, you can only play one kind of card per turn. All the while you learn the story of how the earth got to this ragged state from otherworldly visitors.
